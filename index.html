            <p>“His passion towards human empowerment is clearly visible,” observes the Prime Minister after the Nobel
                laureate called on him on Tuesday.
                Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he had an “excellent” meeting with Economics Nobel laureate
                Abhijit Banerjee on October 22. “Excellent meeting with Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee. His passion
                towards human empowerment is clearly visible. We had a healthy and extensive interaction on various
                subjects. India is proud of his accomplishments. Wishing him the very best for his future endeavours,”
                Mr. Modi said in his official Twitter handle. Dr. Banerjee has been a vocal critic of several of the
                government's economic decisions, including demonetisation, the corporate tax rate cuts, moving items to
                lower GST rates slabs, to name a few. An Indian-born American professor at the Massachusetts Institute
                of Technology, he has won the Nobel in Economics, jointly with wife Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer for
                “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”. Benjamin Netanyahu gave up his effort to form a
                new government on Monday after failing to secure a majority coalition, creating an opportunity for
                centrist rival Benny Gantz to replace Israel's longest serving Prime Minister. Netanyahu, who heads the
                right-wing Likud party, said he had been unable to form a government following an election in September,
                and was returning the mandate back to Israel's President Reuven Rivlin. Rivlin said he intends to task
                Gantz with the job of putting together a new government.Benjamin Netanyahu gave up his effort to form a
